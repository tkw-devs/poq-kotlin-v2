# Repo Browser
An Android application which displays a vertically scrollable list of [Square's](https://square.github.io/) open-source GitHub repositories.
Each list item displays the repository's title, description and owner avatar logo image.

## Project Structure
Repo Browser is written entirely in Kotlin and uses the Gradle build system. It is currently made up of a single module: `app`.

## Architecture
The app follows the [Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) pattern along with the recommendations from Google's [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide):
* The View, represented by an Android Activity, is as lean as possible, handles only UI interactions and observes data through [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) exposed by the ViewModel
* The [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) class provides specific data for the View, wrapped in an observable holder ([LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)) and communicates only with the Model, in order to retrieve and prepare the data for the UI
* The Model, represented by a Repository class, handles data operations off the Main (UI) thread, making use of [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous work, providing a clean API so that the rest of the app can retrieve this data easily

The networking layer is implemented using the [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library and makes calls to [GitHub's v3 REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

## Testing
Unit Tests exist for the presentation and data layers: [RepoBrowserViewModelTest.kt](/app/src/test/java/com/mircea/repobrowser/presentation/RepoBrowserViewModelTest.kt), [DefaultGitHubRepositoryTest.kt](/app/src/test/java/com/mircea/repobrowser/data/DefaultGitHubRepositoryTest.kt).

## Improvement ideas
* Use [paginated API calls](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination) along with the [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) to load and display small chunks of data at a time, to reduce usage of network bandwidth and system resources
* Implement [searching functionality](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/)
* Add detailed view for a GitHub repository
